# GUY_BATTLE

A 2D fighting game I made, written in C using SDL!

I also wrote the music in SuperCollider and drew the art/animations in GIMP.

It's a work in progress right now. Planned features (in order) include:

- Sound effects
- Collisions / hp loss / dying (i.e. the full game loop)
- Support for Linux / Windows
- Three new spells! For a total of five
- Better art for Phoenix Mountain
- AI and 1 player mode
- Improved animations

# Dependencies

# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/mlevatich/GUY_BATTLE.git

Controls can be viewed in game.  Have fun!
